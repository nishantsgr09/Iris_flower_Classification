# Iris_flower_Classification
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

The "Iris" dataset is a well-known dataset used in machine learning and data analysis. It contains information on the measurements of the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of three different species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The dataset consists of 150 observations, with 50 observations per species.

Here are the details of the variables in the dataset:

Sepal length: The length of the sepal of the iris flower (in cm)
Sepal width: The width of the sepal of the iris flower (in cm)
Petal length: The length of the petal of the iris flower (in cm)
Petal width: The width of the petal of the iris flower (in cm)
Species: The species of the iris flower (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica)
